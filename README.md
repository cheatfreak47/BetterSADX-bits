# BetterSADX-bits

This is some bits and pieces from BetterSADX- at the moment very little is here in the actual repo.
This is currently being used as an issue tracker and todo list for upcoming BetterSADX version(s).

The releases section is where _exclusive_ BetterSADX mods are posted publically outside of the BetterSADX patch.
Probably going to use this as the listed update URL once the mod updater gets implemented.
