# BetterSADX-bits

This is some bits and pieces from BetterSADX- at the moment very is here in the actual repo- however.
This is currently being used as an issue tracker and todo list for upcoming BetterSADX version(s).

The releases section is where _exclusive_ BetterSADX mods are posted publically outside of the BetterSADX patch.
Probably going to use this as the listed update URL once the mod updater gets implemented.
